This is also a great game its actually teaching her her ABCs i love watching her learn! Another great one in my book!!;Positive
,Well done;Positive
,Even after paying $5 for the full app I see my toddler getting ads to buy more of their other apps. Frustrating since the playstore opens along with pop-up ads of their other apps that are 15 - 30 seconds long. She likes this app hence the stars, but I have to keep looking at the screen to help her when there are ads. Regret my purchase but can't delete now since she asks for it.;Negative
,Good;Positive
,That's great for learning!!;Positive
,Good app;Positive
,He likes the letters and learning words;Positive
,Good;Positive
,Great so far;Positive
,my daughter loves this game but due to the letter chooser carrying ads for other free games (even though I have paid for the full version of this game), my daughter is able to install apps at will even when I look away for a few minutes. I have had to stop her unless these ads are removed when the game is paid for? Update: yes I agree the other games are not purchasable;Negative
but she still was able to download 4 other demos and ground the phone to a halt;Negative

,App is ok just too many annoying ads so pirchased the app then had a new tablet and got the annoying ads again so contacted their support over a month ago who asked me to send me a picture of the app and attach a receipt of purchase which I did, conersation was 2-3 hours, finally no reply from them for 2 days. So I paid for something I cant have anymore thus the 1 star.;Negative
,Great;Positive
,You have to pay to play with all the letters. You only get a-c other than that you have to buy it. Its ridiculous I would understand if you could only do certain parts of it like certain activities in the letters but only getting 3 letters is ridiculous.;Negative
