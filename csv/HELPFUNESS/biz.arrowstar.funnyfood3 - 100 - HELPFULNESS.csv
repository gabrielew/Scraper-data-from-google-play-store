I have to buy the full version if I want all the games right to start with my daughter could play them all. Now they all locked up but three of the games. Very disappointing!!! Not everybody can afford to always have to buy the full version of the game. Would not recommend this to anybody.;Negative
,App is Very good. But Advertisements more. Kids will Face difficulty. Needs continuous parental supervision. Otherwise kids clicking Ads by mistake. Very difficult to Manage;Positive
,My kid love very much this games. And i did purchased for No Ads, so that they can play freely;Positive
,It is a good game but after 3rd level we have to give money. That's the failure.;Negative

,My three year-old son loves this game and it keeps him very engaged. i like that there are so many variations. it's a very good game for promoting understanding of one-to-one correspondence and number recognition.;Positive
,I downloaded this from my little sister in kindergarten to help her and it's working thank you for whoever make this game;Positive
,Great app but fair to many ads. My 3 year old loves the game and likes to play without help but can't close ads and this is frustrating for him. A kids app should not have ads;Negative
,love this app helped my daughter learn her number very quickly;Positive
she loved playing the different games and would remind me if we didnt play that day;Positive
,Too much ads.;Negative

,Only 3 or so games come free, the rest are paid. Unfortunately it is not stated in the description which games are free or how much it would cost. I would prefer to just purchase an app;Negative
once not the individual games inside. Additionally, after the child does a round there is an ad. Kids accidentally click on the ad trying to get back to the game. Some of the other quality children's apps block the ability to click on ads. All users will have different experiences and needs. This did not fit mine. However I did not find the developers comments to my review appropriate. I treat everything I get for my children the same and I want quality. I am willing to pay when it meets my needs. But the ads and inability to transfer full purchases to multiple devices (as another customer reviewed) does not meet my needs.;Negative
,Nice for my kid and he like so much;Positive
,Update 2/28/19 They finally reached out to me to fix the issue. My son loves this app and now that we have access to all the games he can enjoy it even more. Terrible customer service I;Positive
emailed them and they never emailed me back yet they took my money and the issue is still not resolved. Im trying to figure out what I paid for in the first place. And they still want me;Negative
to pay more money to access all the levels on the app. You only get access to 3 out of 15 levels rip off;Negative
,My Grandbaby loves this app...;Positive
,Adult ads on rewarded video ads? not good for kids, this app designed for you to purchase free ads option and kids click on ads, since rewarded video is 30 seconds duration and after game finished this app shown interstitial ads. Also everytime start this game, you must watch rewarded videos again and again. Not safe for kids for free version, your kids will click the ads.;Negative
,Would be okay if it wasn't for all the ads. I completely understand needing to make money, but seriously needing an ad every two minutes is ridiculous. Especially ones that toddlers won't be able to get around.;Negative
,Way too many ads that require a parent to X out of them every 3 minutes and the ads are in appropriate for this age group! Daughter likes the game but I can't let her play anymore because of above complaints.;Negative
,this game is very usefull my child thx funny food.?.. .......;Positive

,can't run video's to play new games. very frustrating;Negative
,My son loves the app, but paying 4 bucks for an app he can only have access to on my cell phone because I downloaded it while I was out and about is not cool. Please figure out how to fix this.;Negative
,My child 4 year old boy loves this app! its great but should have all the mini games free!;Positive
,Why do you not offer family devices installation. Bought it for my son whilst we where out thinking I could put it on the tablet he uses when we get home to discover that this 'Family friendly' Game will not install for my Family. My son only got my phone as we didn't have his tablet whilst we where at hospital. Will not make any more purchases if I can't put it on his device, no matter how much He loves them as I make purchases on my device and transfer them via family library to his tablet. that way I don't have to link my toddler to any form of payment and stop any problems many other parents face with children spending.;Negative
