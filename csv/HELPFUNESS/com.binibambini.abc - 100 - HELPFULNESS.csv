my daughter loves this game but due to the letter chooser carrying ads for other free games (even though I have paid for the full version of this game), my daughter is able to install apps at will even when I look away for a few minutes. I have had to stop her unless these ads are removed when the game is paid for? Update: yes I agree the other games are not purchasable but she still was able to download 4 other demos and ground the phone to a halt;Negative
,Even after paying $5 for the full app I see my toddler getting ads to buy more of their other apps. Frustrating since the playstore opens along with pop-up ads of their other apps that are 15 - 30 seconds long. She likes this app hence the stars, but I have to keep looking at the screen to help her when there are ads. Regret my purchase but can't delete now since she asks for it.;Negative
,App is ok just too many annoying ads so pirchased the app then had a new tablet and got the annoying ads again so contacted their support over a month ago who asked me to send me a picture of the app and attach a receipt of purchase which I did, conersation was 2-3 hours, finally no reply from them for 2 days. So I paid for something I cant have anymore thus the 1 star.;Negative
,bad app, I would not recommend it because you will not be able to install on your other devices, sounds bad. PS: did a hard reset on my device, restored from backup, but it is not purchased as of yet. How long to wait for unlook?;Negative
,You have to pay to play with all the letters. You only get a-c other than that you have to buy it. Its ridiculous I would understand if you could only do certain parts of it like certain activities in the letters but only getting 3 letters is ridiculous.;Negative
,This is also a great game its actually teaching her her ABCs i love watching her learn! Another great one in my book!!;Positive
,Seems like a decent game for the small amount of time my 4yr old son & I played. My 2yr old was also able to participate which worked out well for the 3 of us!!;Positive
,This version of additional challenges is fun, exciting, enjoyable moves to go through, my Two years old will enjoy this. Good job;Positive
,Great app!! Nice graphics fun games very educational similar apps cost $ this is free. My 3 year old loves it!! Best learning app we have found!;Positive
,Great app but there shouldn't be ads on a kid's app and there A LOT of ads.;Negative
,Seems like a great learning tool. The 3 year old I take care of has really picked up on his letters faster and it's so much fun for him!;Positive
,So happy they changed the game for kids to learn all the letters for free by just watch ads.;Positive

,My son really enjoys this game. He picks this over anything else to play. He is really learning and is now recognizing most letters and numbers outside the app. He is excited to point them out in the community. He just turned 2 yrs old and is headed for a bright future. Your apps are a big part of his learning and we will continue to use them. Thanks Bini Bambini☺;Positive
,Very fun and educational for preschoolers;Positive
,This is probably our favorite version of all of the Bambini app family. It has the features we like the most that our younger toddler is into at the moment, like practicing handwriting and matching puzzle objects and the play like nature of bambini's apps makes it so much more fun for learning!;Positive
,Good so far. I like the repetition of learning the letters and the little things to distract the child to help increase their attention and awareness.;Positive
,Great game for kids to learn they abcs.;Positive

,Only 6 letters are free in this app. Try kids.mbt.harfler application on google play for totally ad free and fully functional letters and words learning experience;Negative
,controls are too complicated for a child.;Negative
,I would like to suggest a screen lock mode when playing as well as removing the home button from the game screen. When my son plays (1 and a half) he tends to accidentally hit the home button a lot and it frustrates him. If those are changed, 5 stars. I have purchased the app as well and love the boxesABC addition to the gameplay!;Positive
,This is so creative!! I love it!!;Positive
,amazing and lots of fun and laughs;Positive
,my son love it realy good just need more English language;Positive
,My 1 year old and I Love this game!;Positive
,I installed this app and bought the extended version but after a week it disappeared from my I pad and couldn't reinstall it... waste of money!;Negative
,my 2 yr old is intentionally choosing the wrong letter in one of the games because the character will jump to the wrong platform which then disappears and makes him fall. He thinks is the most hilarious thing in the world every single time it happens. it's extremely entertaining just watching him play. Great App;Positive
,this is the best abc game for 2 and more years old thanks;Positive
,the games are good for teaching but ads keep popping up which means i will constantly have to stop play to decline ads;Negative
,Asking for money all the time!!!! Children will normally press what they see and that happens here too....most of the game is locked to players and to unlock the only way is to pay! This is unfair for children. Therfore 1 star rating is more than fair! Thank you;Negative
,Insightful and fun;Positive
,way to many ads!!! my daughter gets frustrated when the pop up, especially the longer ones like for 25-30 seconds. she doesnt want to wait and sit through it to continue to play. other then that she likes the app.;Positive
,My 2 year old loves this app. It's amazing how quickly he was able to pick this up. It didn't take long before he'd mastered it, yet he still loves playing it regularly. I enjoy watching him have fun as he learns.;Positive
,my 2 year old loves this game. thinking of unlocking full version no ads if available.;Positive
,I like the app although it's a little hard for a 4 year old to understand how to control a mouse to play. wish it was a little more preK firiendly .;Positive
,my almost 3 year old loves this game. some parts of the game can be challenging because his dexterity is not sharp and some parts move too fast for him.;Positive
,Great game but why are we getting ads for other games in the paid for version it really upsets the flow of the game when my daughter presses on one of the touted games, please stop it.;Negative
,So Happy my daughter loves this fun learning game !! She loves using the app on her own with the easy controls. She says it makes her feel like a big girl . Plus I can't complain with her eagerness to learn her letters.;Positive

And the alphabet is A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J ,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z Is the alphabet!all kids should have to had this game about the alphabet. Thank you and thats it.;Positive
,¡Muchas gracias! Thank you for this funny, educational and interactive application. We love it! The negative aspect is how to leave the interface. It is a problem.;Positive

,amazing game for toddlers;Positive
,Game & graphics are all good but , after alphabet (G) ask for buy full version, ask for money so don't download, u will disappoint after;Negative
,We love this app. it keeps my children busy for 30 minutes or more. The games are self correcting which my children believe it is all gol;Positive
,Would be great, if not for the multiple links to other games that my kid keeps pressing. That takes her out of the game and into the play store.;Negative
