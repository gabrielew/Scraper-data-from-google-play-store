,I just downloaded this app for my two year old DS (dear son) yesterday. I have been telling EVERYONE about this app lol and they have all downloaded it as well. I love the no ads & no in store purchases, because it makes it so much easier for us to navigate without interruption. They also have spelling, counting, etc I downloaded all of them and my son is enjoying it. Thank you, for creating such a wonderful app keep them coming.;Positive
,My 18 month old loves this app. I have it installed for the times she gets at my phone, and she gets excited when she hears the music or Lucas and Ruby talking while it's loading. She's;Positive
already tracing the letters and will bring the phone to me to help her with the letters she can't quite get yet. I love that after every few letters, it gives a sticker or a box to give them a little bit of a break. All in all, great app!;Positive
,I love this app! My little one loves it too! It is very thoughtful, contains no ads (!!!!), entertaining and indeed helps to learn in the most cheerful and encouraging way! I specifically love the feature of smart application closing, so that the child could safely learn and not rambler around the rest of the phone's apps. There's also a smart way to enter the parents' zone with typing spelled numbers. Kudos to the developers, wishes of a great inspiration and success on your future projects!;Positive
,The game is kind of boring but it helps the kids learn;Positive
,Awesome program, however sound effects over/very close to letter pronunciation makes it difficult to hear the letter spoken. This is especially apparent in the capital/lower case match game. My daughter absolutely loves playing letters on my phone. Excellent array of apps from developer. Thank you;Positive
,Amazing app helps my child learn a lot more I recommend you download it;Positive
,My 3 year old enjoys the app and is excited to do her homework. Lol;Positive
,ok, please do not judge me. I'm 31 years old and I downloaded this game because we didn't have stuff like this when I was in school. we had the Jumpstart games. anyway super adorable and even for someone my age it's addicting. I recommend this for both young kids and kids at heart like me! great job guys and keep it up;Positive
,My son is 4, the youngest of four children still at home. He wants to learn to read, but was getting discouraged and frustrated trying to learn the letters with traditional flash cards.;Negative
Since we've started this app, he is excited about learning and in only about 10 days, he has started remembering his letters better! Thank you so much!;Positive
,I like the app, but wish I could mute it entirely. I would be able to use my phone for multitasking while my daughter plays with the app. At times, I need to listen to podcasts or audiobooks, neither of which this app will allow while she is playing.;Positive
,No ads simple and useful;Positive
,awesome! my 3 years old niece can follow and trace letters. i HOPE u can include an audio so children can hear the letters/numbers repeatedly. is it possible? whenever they touch the LCD/monitor a sounds of that particular characters will have audio? thanks and more power. stay blessed guys!;Positive
,I wish this were in Spanish! It would be great to have it in more than one language!;Positive
,I downloaded 5 if all the Rv apps for my daughter and sinice of late the 'Colors & Shapes' as well as the 'Puzzle Kids' freezes when it loads to 100% and doesn't open. The ABC Tracing and Phonics stopped giving the option the go the another letter when you're through tracing, have not been able to select upper or lowercase letters and if I select 'don't ask again' the page loads but doesn't show image when you select letter nor does it gives option to move on. Same thing when matching letters.;Negative
,Dear Team, RV Studio, the app you developed is really wonderful for the child and specially this is gift to every child which is priceless ... that makes it awesome But one request that;Positive
make alphabet related picture same for everytime it changes randomly through which a child gets confused about the pronouncing and corelating the alphabet with picture. Rest is perfect;Positive
,I can give 5 star. But i have to stay with my son all the times as the next button (arrow key) doesn't response quickly. Even when i tried myself too. Kindly fix the bugs not only in this app but in other apps too. Thank you very much.;Positive
,Excellent app for helping toddlers gain their confidence in learning to trace the alphabet. 3yr old loves his game. App is interactive and kids earn a sticker after completing a few letters. There aren't any in app purchases or adds which is great.;Positive
,Awesome In Every Way! My son loves this app on his tablet so much that my wife and I are downloading it onto our phones so he can enjoy it on the go! I would only suggest 2 changes: 1. Create an app space where kids can access all your apps (that have been downloaded) without having to back out to the phone's OS. 2. Add a donation button! I would love to give to the cause and help you create more apps, but I'm not a mobile gamer so buying your games for adults isn't feasible.;Positive
,I believe this app is an amazing learning tool for toddlers including mine.. my little one learns the letters both upper case and lower case while learning how to write them as well. I would definitely recommend this app to other parents looking for other ways to teach their children the basics before and after pre school.. I do have one suggestion, maybe adding the option to trace the lower case letters (side by side) with the upper case letters so that the children can see the difference.;Positive
,Excellent app. My son reallt ikes it. Extremely kid friendlybecause no ads. Most of the other apps are running ads and my kid always hit them. This one has given all the features for free... I would like to recommend small words combining three letters for writing. Best if we cam define our own words.. Eg:- Kid's name.. etc.. Thank you very much again for making it free. I'll definately buy it if it comes with above features.;Positive
,I would definitely like if I give 5 star to this app as its great but only thing I would like you to add or make change is to let the kid play, currently in other teaching/ tracing apps;Positive
even with a slight touch the other app consider it is written/works here it doesnt;Negative
,After the last update the app stopped working properly, which made my child cry. This was my childs favorite game to play. It is a real shame that it doesn't work anymore. The tracing of the letters does not advance to the next letter. You can not draw a line from the upper case letters to the lower case letters and vice versa. You can not open the section to find the letter in the balloons that they are asking for.;Negative
,Free of ads and fully educative.;Positive
,Thanks for the app! The games are easy to use and attention keeping for the 14mo. Draw backs: 1-On the tablet the app is not locked in place so the child cannot go exploring else where when they slide there hand/finger across the screen and hit the command areas. So parents don't walk away. 2-There needs to be a tab in settings fo the story just like the more apps tab. Show or not show. She gets flustered when she hit that and it will not go away fo her. thnaks for the app. 2019May22;Positive
,Really love the no ads! My son plays on this for hours and doesnt realize he's doing educational learning! We really love this app and thankful they made a numerical one also!;Positive
,Good app for kids to learn alphabets.;Positive
,I'm rating 1 star instead of 5 sadly because it just stopped working on my device and my son can't stop crying because he loves it... please fix (still doesn't work after update) the app is awesome....it worked after clearing the app data and cache!!! thank you so much... my son is enjoying it again,awesome application.;Positive
,this game is great for my kids. i love how there are zero ads for my kids to click on and take them on a wild pop up adventure through the internet. the other games they have to offer are great too, if you have little kids, this is a great learning app for them;Positive
,Mostly a good game, but in the tracing game they should state the letter after the kid has traced it not only just before, so that it's reinforced.;Positive
,My DS has been using it since it for the past 2 years and it has helped him a lot. He absolutely loves it.;Positive
,No ads! Better than the ones that do have ads. I need to see how I can donate to their cause myself, because they don't bug you or your kid asking for money, and I greatly appreciate that.;Positive
,wow! really it's a wonderful app for learning alphabets for children. but something I want to say that, there should be an option to repeat letters pronunciation then it will help a lot;Positive
for everyone! hope you understand.;Positive
,i love that this app is free to help support families so all kids have a chance at learning.;Positive
,it's fun and interesting for my children. It also encourages my daughter (who has special needs) to trace. Would like to see however the level of difficulty increase as it goes along so;Positive
eventually users will be able to trace independently.;Neutral

,Thank you so much for this wonderful app. So helpful for us when we don't have time for preschool lessons.;Positive
,It was very helpful for my daughter to understand and learn through this game;Positive
,NOT PHONETICS! So this really annoys me to enable kinds to learn to read the the most effect way is to teach the PHONETICS AS IN THE SOUND OF THE LETTER! So by this and as I teacher myself pre-school to end of primary we first teach the phonetics ONLY!!!! A AS IN AAA not ay B an baa so please get what a phonetic is properly!! Age three is introduces to phonetics as in the baby language letters. PLEASE CONSIDER SITTING WITH ACTUAL TEACHERS who have worked in an array of teaching methods.;Negative
