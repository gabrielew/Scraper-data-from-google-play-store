My kids loves it. It was worth the 5 dollars to have the ads removed however there should really be no links to other apps once its paid for. The point of getting rid of the ads was so my daughter wouldn't open random links. Also it would be great to get harder levels after these are mastered. All in all it keeps my daughter entertained and i would recommend it :);Positive
,WAY too many ads. Parents: don't even bother. Devs: shame on you. I'm happy to spend money on a quality app but this is just shameless. EDIT: I'm fine with ads. No problems with ads at all. To be clear, you have way too many of them. More than one fullscreen advertisement per minute is too much.;Negative
,Kid likes it but ads will not go away. Paid for no ads and there are still ads at the top. My kiddo thinks those are part of this game and cries when they dont work. Really wish paying would get rid of all ads. It just gets rid of third party ads so other games from same developer still show.;Negative
,Paid for the ads to be removed and developer still have advertisements that deceives my child to download another app from them and pay again. The app uses dark patterns such as putting;Negative
an app link to the store where the child should press continue playing. Definitely takes advantage of gaming to get more downloads and money. Requested a refund and developer refuses to refund.;Negative
,I really enjoy how the games are Interactive and my daughter loves the games. But the ads are incredibly ridiculous. An ad after every game is ridiculous.;Negative
,If your on a budget like me. This is perfect for you 3 year and they learn and it only cost 4 buck for no adds. Unlike the other company who just make you play month to month;Positive

,4 year old son likes it, but there is no prompts/instruction at begging of each game which can be confusing as they have to try & figure out the aim/goal of game on their own. Also too many pop ups. otherwise a fun game.;Positive

,The games were fun and really engaged my child in learning opportunities. The graphics were well done and the music was not annoying or shrill. The problem was even after paying $5 for no ads, it still constantly interrupted game selection and progress with requests to rate and opened Play Store for more games. This was very frustrating for my child and ended up making him not want to use the app.;Negative
