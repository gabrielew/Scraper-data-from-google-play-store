"well my 5 year old did a reset on the tablet and it deleted the whole tablet and now I can't figure out why they are locked again. I thought we get to keep the apps forever after we purchase them. Please let me know what I can do to recover my sons games I paid for he's really upset about not being able to play. I'm using the same Gmail account I was using when we purchased. Can you search somehow and find them? I can't afford to pay for the apps again. Thank you so much.;";Negative
